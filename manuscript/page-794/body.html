He had never done this before. The spools of wire weighed on him heavily. A crowbar thrust through the core made them a sort of axle with which to carry it. Thus they walked forward, revolving the heavy spool with the greatest care while the strand of wire unwound behind them.

Jack Pollock seemed familiar with the idiosyncrasies of the stuff, for he suffered little damage.</p></div> </div>
