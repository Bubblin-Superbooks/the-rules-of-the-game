<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Bob took the paper Harvey extended to him. He found it to be a list, including hundreds of items. The first few lines were like this:</p><p>Sec. 4 T, 6 N.R., 26 W S.W. 1/4 of N.W. 1/4<br>4       6          26     N.W. 1/4 of N.W. 1/4<br>4       6          26     S.W. 1/4 of S.W. 1/4<br>5       6          26     S.W. 1/4 of N.W. 1/4<br>5       6          26     S.E. 1/4 of N.W. 1/4</p><p>After an interminable sequence, another of the figures would change, or a single letter of the alphabet would shift. And so on, column after column. Bob had not the remotest notion of what it all meant, but he copied it and handed the result to Harvey. In a few moments Harvey returned.</p><p>"Did you verify this?" he asked.</p><p>"What?" Bob inquired.</p><p>"Verify it, check it over, compare it," snapped Harvey, impatiently.</p></div> </div>
