I haven't any desire to raise a fuss, nor start any trouble; but if you are bound to get Mr. Welton in on this, I might as well get you both in.' He'd back out, you see!"</p><p>"I believe he would!" cried Bob. "It's a good bluff to make."</p><p>"It mustn't be a bluff," warned Amy. "You must mean it. I don't believe he wants to face a criminal charge just to get Mr. Welton in trouble, if he realizes that you are both going to testify anyway. But if he thinks you're bluffing, he'll carry it through."</p><p>"You're right," said Bob slowly. "If necessary, we must carry it through ourselves."</p><p>Amy nodded.</p><p>"I'll take down a letter for you to Baker," she said, "and type it out this evening. We'll say nothing to anybody."</p></div> </div>
