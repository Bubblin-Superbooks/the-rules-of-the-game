A narrow trough made of small peeled logs laid parallel and pegged and mortised together at the ends, ran straight over the next hill.</p><p>"That's a chute," he explained briefly. "We hitch a wire cable to the log and just naturally yank it over to the chute."</p><p>"How yank it?" demanded Bob.</p><p>"By a good, husky donkey engine. Then the chute poles are slushed, we hitch cables on four or five logs, and just tow them over the hill to the mill."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Bob's enthusiasm, as always, was growing with the presentation of this new and mighty problem of engineering so succinctly presented. It sounded simple; but from his two years' experience he knew better. He was becoming accustomed to filling in the outlines of pure theory. At a glance he realized the importance of such things as adequate anchors for the donkey engines;</p></div> </div>
