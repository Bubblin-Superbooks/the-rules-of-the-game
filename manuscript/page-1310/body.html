<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">situation is changed. I'm being bribed."</p><p>"Bribed!" Amy cried, throwing her head back.</p><p>"Extra inducements offered. They make it hard for me to refuse, without seeming positively brutal. They offer me complete charge—to do as I want. I can run the works absolutely according to my own ideas. Don't you see how I am going to hurt them when I refuse under such circumstances?"</p><p>"Refuse!" cried Amy. "Refuse! What do you mean!"</p><p>"Do you think I ought to leave the Service?" stammered Bob blankly.</p><p>"Why, it's the best chance the Service has ever had!" said Amy, the words fairly tumbling over one another. "You must never dream of refusing. It's your chance—it's our chance. It's the one thing we've lacked, the opportunity of showing lumbermen everywhere that the thing can be made to pay. It's the one thing we've lacked. Oh, <em>what</em> a chance!"</p></div> </div>
