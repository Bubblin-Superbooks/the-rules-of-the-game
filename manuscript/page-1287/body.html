I'll tell you all the details some other time. On the road I met Newmark. I was pretty mad, so I lit into him stiff-legged. After a few words he got scared and pulled a gun on me. I was just mad enough to keep coming, and I swear I believe he was just on the point of shooting, when I said those very same words: 'I'm going to give you the very worst licking you ever heard tell of.' He turned white as a sheet and dropped his gun. I thought he was a coward; but I guess it was conscience and luck. Now, wouldn't that come and get you?"</p><p>"Did you?" asked Orde.</p><p>"Did I what?"</p><p>"Give him that licking?"</p><p>"I sure did start out to; but I couldn't bring myself to more than shake him up a little."</p></div> </div>
