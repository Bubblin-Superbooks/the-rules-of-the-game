Because if it ain't you'd better put it in writing and make it official. Step right in and do it now!"</p><p>Brent looked at him in slight bewilderment.</p><p>"I'm willing to hear your talk," went on California John quietly. "Some of it's good talk, even if it ain't put out in no very good spirit; and I ain't kicking on criticismâ€”that's what I'm here for, and what you're here for. But I ain't here for no <em>private</em> remarks. If you've got anything to kick on, put it down and sign it and send it on. I'll stand for it, and explain it if I can; or take my medicine if I can't. But anything you ain't ready and willing to report on, I don't want to take from you private. <em>Sabe?</em>"</p></div> </div>
