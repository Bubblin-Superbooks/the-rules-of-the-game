"Come on. I'm going to look at the stream."</p><p>"Not at a run," protested Welton. "No, sir! At a nice, middle-aged, dignified, fat <em>walk</em>!"</p><p>They sauntered down the length of the trestle, with its miniature steel tracks, to where the flume began.

Welton pointed to the telephone wire that paralleled it.</p><p>"When we get going," said he, "we just turn the stream in here, clamp our sawn lumber into bundles of the right size, and 'let her went!' There'll be three stations along the line, connected by 'phone, to see that things go all right. That flume's six mile long."</p><p>Bob strode to the gate, and after some heaving and hauling succeeded in throwing water into the flume.</p></div> </div>
